## Project Overview

I have been recruited by a local business to perform data analysis on recent sales data with a view to providing evidence-based conclusions and plans to help move the business through a period of transition. 

## Business Requirements
Pizza Passions is a small family-run business that has been steadily growing over a number of years. Recently, increases in labour, ingredients and utility costs however are starting to dramatically cut into the profitability of the business, resulting in the need to look at all aspects of the business to improve efficiency. This part of the project is to assess the last years worth of sales, to identify trends and patterns that can either be used to reduce costs, increase sales or profit margins. 

As the contracted Data Analyst, I have been given data for the last 12 months of sales, outlining the types of pizza purchased, the size, time & date of purchase and the overall sales value. I will make sure that the data is first cleaned and standardised before looking at possible hypotheses, before creating visualisations to interpret the data, and then finally, to draw conclusions as to possible steps to move forward. 

## Objectives

 * To clean and validate the provided data to check for consistency and value
 * To identify key market drivers and trends from the historical data
 * To analyse and produce projections using machine learning to look at possible future growth opportunities 
 * To produce visual models for a range of different audiences to show findings and future plans 
 * To provide hypotheses as to reasons for the current situation, assess how accurate they are and then provide key steps to move forward

 ## Hypotheses

Given the nature and scale of the data, it will be impossible to provide a narrative around costs and profits, as neither is given as part of the dataset. As such, any hypotheses will have to be based on sales trends and pizza types.

**Hypotheses**
 1. On average, more orders will be placed per day on weekends rather than weekdays, and in the evenings, rather than daytime.

     **Validation:**  The sales data provided gives an order time, as such I will be able to review both total orders placed, as well as the total sales for various time periods. 

2. Medium pizza will be the most purchased item.

    **Validation:** Given the data I will be able to see what size of pizza is the most commonly purchased. Additionally, as I nice to have and time willing, I will review if these trends change at different times of day.

3. Orders placed during peak hours have a longer ingredients list.

    **Validation:** I can compare the average ingredient count during peak and off-peak hours. 

4. Pineapple should not be on pizza.

    **Validation:** I can compare the amount of order that are placed that have pineapple as a topping on the pizza. 


## Dataset and collection
The data provided has 12 columns and 48,620 rows, excluding headers.

## Project Interaction

The goal of this project was to provide an overall narrative for possible business improvements, as well as two sets of visualisations to be completed. 
The first, using Python, would be a technical deep dive into the data, using Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly to visualise the data.
The second was to provide an interactive dashboard for casual users to be easily able draw their own insights from a range of different data points. For this task I chose to use PowerBi.



## Methodology

The project will follow templates and guidelines from the training content of

 * **Data Collection & Preparation**: Imported the dataset, handled missing values, and cleaned data for consistency.

 * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated distributions of key variables and relationships between user demographics, behaviour, and engagement.

 * **Machine Learning**: Built and evaluated predictive models, including linear regression.

 * **Visualisation**: Developed an interactive dashboard to present insights tailored for business and product stakeholders.
